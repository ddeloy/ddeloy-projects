**Azure Boards - Kanban Board**

- The Hai Kanban board turns the backlog into an interactive signboard, which provides a visual flow of work.
 
- As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. 

- Each column represents a work stage. 

- Each card represents a backlog item, or bug at that stage of work.

- We can use work items to share information, assign work to team members, update status, track dependencies, and more.

- the Hal Kanban board is one of two types of boards available to the project. The other is the Sprint Taskboard which will be outlined in another wiki doc. 

- Kanban boards track requirements, are sprint-independent, and provide a cumulative flow chart for monitoring progress.

**Azure Board - Columns**

- When you first open your Kanban board, you'll see one column for each workflow state.

- The columns are based on the process the team will use. For the Agile template, the Product Backlog Items flow from **New -> Active -> Resolved -> Closed**

**Important Note ** If further states are required to refine the process further this is possible and can be added as required by the project.**

** Azure Board - Swimlanes**

- The Kanban board supports the ability to visualize the flow of work as it moves from new to done. 

- The use of swimlanes can also visualize the status of different classes of work. For Hal, a number of swimlanes have been created which allows work to be broken down by different workstreams.

**Azure Boards - Definition of Done/Closed**

- As your team updates the status of work as it progresses from one stage to the next, it helps that they agree on what "done/closed" means. 

- By specifying the Definition of Closed criteria for each Kanban column, the team can help share the essential tasks to complete before moving an item into the next column. When set, team members can quickly double-check the closed criteria.
