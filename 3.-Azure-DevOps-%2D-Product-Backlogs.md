**Product Backlogs**

- The product backlog corresponds to the projects plan of work or roadmap for what your team plans to deliver. 

- It should evolve so long as your project/product exists, and should be a prioritized list of features and requirements to build.

- The backlog also provides a repository of all the information you need to track and share with your team.

- The backlog consists of a list of work items. You use work items to share information, assign work to team members, track dependencies, organize work, and more.Because the most important work appears at the top of the list, your team always knows what to work on next.

**How to view Hal Backlog**

- Select **Boards > Backlogs** and then select **H20.ai**

- After you have some items in your backlog, you can reorder them to create a prioritized list of work. 

- Review and prioritize your backlog frequently to help your team know what's most important to deliver next. (Note: To reorder a backlog, you must must have Basic or higher level access.)

- To reorder your backlog, drag the work items. Or, if you prefer to use the keyboard, hold down the Alt key and use the up and down arrows.

**Adding tasks to backlog items**

- For each sprint backlog item, you can (optionally) add a task. Adding tasks from the sprint backlog or board automatically links the task to its parent backlog item.

- You can add tasks from the Kanban Board, Sprint Backlog or Taskboard.
From the Kanban Board view click the sign, then Add Task and add a task title.
