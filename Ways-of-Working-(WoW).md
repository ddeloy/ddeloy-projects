#### A list of rules, expectations, and procedures to help govern how teams will work together


## The Agreement
Ways of working can "loosely" be defined as a list of rules, expectations, and procedures that govern how teams will work together.
- Outside of the scrum framework but can be used by a lot of team members
- Accessible and visible (not dogmatic -  a dynamic, living document)
- Simply an agreement that “I do my part to make things happen”
- Help new team members to understand the project, team mindset (easy for many of us who have been on the project for quite some time to take this for granted)


**The WoW is not meant to dictate** precisely how work gets done, but more to keep everyone maximumly productive and positive.<br/>
**A WoW can be whatever we want it to be** and include whatever we collectively agree to include: ie:  how we communicate with one another, processes, etc.<br/>
**It’s essentially what we're looking to accomplish** and what the expectations are as part of the team.<br/>
Making certain assumptions, identifying challenges => facilitate conversation, change and update as needed...

##Two key elements:
####1. Definition of Ready (DOR)
**Definition of Ready** - as applies to User Stories<br/>
When is a User story Ready?
Who, What, Why
- Who is the customer: Who is going to use it; who are the end-users?
- What do they want?
- Why do they need it?

Acceptance Criteria:
- Needs to be in place before a developer even picks up the work
- Explicit
- Clear, concise and actionable
- Polished and non-ambiguous

What specifically needs to be done and the level of complexity of the work?

####2. Definition of Done (DOD)
**Definition of Done** - how do we know when we are done?<br/>
(No such thing as almost done - almost there)<br/>
What does it mean to get a story done?
- The User Story meets the acceptance criteria
- Unit testing
- Code reviews, peer reviews
- Integration testing (this user story didn't break other features)
- Lightweight documentation of what was done (product owner for final review; where applicable)
- Ready for PwC to QA Test
