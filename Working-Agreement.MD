# Working Agreement / Ways of Working
#### A list of rules, expectations, and procedures to help govern how teams will work together

## Overview
We have a very aggressive development schedule regarding the rapid implementation of new FSLI’s that will necessitate a well-coordinated effort  (both PwC and H2O).<br/>
We’ll likely see the formation of “sub-teams” to work on new modules (while maintaining current ones).<br/>
Additionally, as new team members are added we need an efficient way to help them get "up to speed" as quickly as possible.

Now, more than ever, we need an extremely collaborative environment where all entities are on the same page and pulling toward common goals.

**If we create Working Agreements, will that help the team to work more effectively together?**

**Are there decisions that, if made now, could help us in the future when the pressure is on, or things haven’t gone our way?**

## The Agreement
A Working agreement / Ways of working can "loosely" be defined as a list of rules, expectations, and procedures that govern how teams will work together.
- Outside of the scrum framework but can be used by a lot of team members
- Accessible and visible (not dogmatic -  a dynamic, living document)
- Simply an agreement that “I do my part to make things happen”
- Help new team members to understand the project, team mindset (easy for many of us who have been on the project for quite some time to take this for granted)

We have a "multiplayer game" at several different levels...
- PwC
    - Within PwC
- H2O
    - Within H2O
- Between PwC and H2O - in general

**A working agreement is not meant to dictate** precisely how work gets done, but more to keep everyone maximumly productive and positive.<br/>
**A working agreement can be whatever we want it to be** and include whatever we collectively agree to include: ie:  how we communicate with one another, processes, etc.<br/>
**It’s essentially what we're looking to accomplish** and what the expectations are as part of the team.<br/>
Making certain assumptions, identifying challenges => facilitate conversation, change and update as needed...

#### Ideally, a simple one-page document that includes the following key elements:
####1. Definition of Ready (DOR)
**Definition of Ready** - as applies to User Stories
When is a User story Ready?
Who, What, Why
- Who is the customer: Who is going to use it; who are the end-users?
- What do they want?
- Why do they need it?

Acceptance Criteria:
- Needs to be in place before a developer even picks up the work
- Explicit
- Clear, concise and actionable
- Polished and non-ambiguous

What specifically needs to be done and the level of complexity of the work?

####2. Definition of Done (DOD)
**Definition of Done** - how do we know when we are done?
(No such thing as almost done - almost there)
What does it mean to get a story done?
- The User Story meets the acceptance criteria
- Unit testing
- Code reviews, peer reviews
- Integration testing (this user story didn't break other features)
- Lightweight documentation of what was done (product owner for final review)
- Accepted by the product owner: ready to "Go Live"
