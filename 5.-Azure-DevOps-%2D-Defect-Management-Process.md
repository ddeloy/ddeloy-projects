**Defect Management Process - Introduction**

To ensure the success of Hal, it is imperative that there is a robust defect management process in place where roles and responsibilities are understood during the defect lifecycle and defect statuses are correct at all times to ensure efficient resolution and closure. This guide will set out the overall approach in achieving this.

The guide will provide the following information:

- Outline the defect tracking process.

- The responsibilities of testing and development when a defect is raised.

- Description of the different states of a defect.

**Defect Lifecycle**

The following diagrams outlines the defect management process for Agile and Scrum projects. Either process can be used for projects.

**Defect Reporting**

Current status of defects will be held within Azure DevOps, however details on current statuses of defects by functional area and severity will be provided as part of the QA dashboard.

**Defect Severity Levels**

The following table illustrates the severity levels that can be applied to a defect.

**Severity Level Description**

**1 - Critical** The defect results in failure of the complete software system, subsystem, or software unit within the system. Prevents further testing continuing.

**2 - High** The item under test does not function as expected/specified. Workaround is available

**3 - Medium** The defect does not result in a failure, but causes the system to produce incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent results, or the defect impairs the systems usability.

**4 - Low Cosmetic** the defect that is not critical to the operation of the system. The defect does not result in a failure, does not impair usability, and the desired processing results are easily obtained by working around the defect.

**Priority Level Description**

**1 - Resolve Immediately** - Further testing cannot occur until the defect has been fixed. The application cannot be used.

**2 - Give High Attention** - The defect must be resolved as soon as possible as it impairs testing activities. Application is severely affected until the defect is fixed.

**3 - Normal Queue** - The defect should be resolved in the normal course of development activities.

**4 - Low Priority** - The defect is a problem which should be repaired but can wait until more serious defects have been fixed.
