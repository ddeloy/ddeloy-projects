# QA Workflow


<br>
<br>

###Definitions of a Bug, Defect and Change Request:
- a Bug (broken or non working function) 
- a Defect (functionality not aligned with acceptance criteria) 
- a Change request (a change to previously stated requirements discovered while testing; may in the form of a user story, feature or epic).

:information_source: Bugs and Defects in ADO are managed as "work item = Bug" in ADO; Change Requests would be "work item = User Story or Feature or Epic".
